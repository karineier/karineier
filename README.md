### Hello ðŸ‘‹! I'm a postdoctoral scholar at UC Davis and my bioinformatics research is focused on analyzing and integrating mutli-'omic data, including RNA-seq, 16S microbiome sequencing, whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing (WGBS), and metabolomic data. Examples of this work can be found in the following publications:

* ["Sex disparate gut microbiome and metabolome perturbations precede disease progression in a mouse model of Rett syndrome"](https://rdcu.be/cDkCI)

* ["Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of neurodevelopmental disorder genes in mouse placenta and fetal brain following prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.27.446011v1)

I'm looking to continue gaining insights into the biology and pathophysiology of neurological and metabolic disorders by integrating single-cell sequencing data with bulk sequencing data and metabolomics by expanding my skills in R and Python.
